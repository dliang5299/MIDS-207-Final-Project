## About The Project

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models particularly suited for processing structured grid-like data, such as images and videos. They are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features through a series of convolutional layers. Each layer consists of filters that convolve over input data, capturing local patterns and features. CNNs are widely used in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and facial recognition due to their ability to effectively handle spatial relationships and hierarchical patterns within data.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:** Copy this repository to your local machine.
2. **Download the Dataset:** Download the dataset from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/erichqiu/nba-odds-and-scores?resource=download).
3. **Save the Dataset:** Save the `NBA data - processed` file into a folder named `NBA Data`.
4. **Load the Dataset:** The notebook is configured to load the dataset from the `NBA Data` folder. Ensure that the file path is correct.
5. **Additional Configuration:** Additional configuration might be needed based on your environment and setup.

## Recommendations

We strongly suggest using Google Colab to execute the notebook and leveraging a TPU environment for running the code, especially if you plan to train the models yourself.
